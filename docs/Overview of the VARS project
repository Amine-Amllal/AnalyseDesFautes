Overview of the VARS Project
============================

The **VARS Project** (Vector Autoregressive System) is designed to analyze and forecast multivariate time series data by capturing the linear interdependencies among multiple variables over time. The project focuses on building robust VAR models to understand dynamic relationships in economic, financial, or other complex datasets.

Key objectives of the VARS project include:

- **Modeling multivariate time series:** Understand how variables influence each other over time through lagged relationships.
- **Forecasting:** Produce reliable short- and medium-term predictions for multiple variables simultaneously.
- **Impulse response analysis:** Examine how shocks to one variable affect the others in the system over time.
- **Variance decomposition:** Identify the contribution of each variableâ€™s shocks to the forecast error variance of others.
- **Application:** Support decision-making in fields like economics, finance, or any domain requiring multivariate time-dependent analysis.

The project implements state-of-the-art statistical tools and validation techniques to ensure model accuracy and interpretability. It also provides a user-friendly interface or dashboard for visualization and scenario analysis.
